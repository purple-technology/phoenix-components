# Colors

## Color Theme

Phoenix components use 6 different "theme colors" as a `ColorTheme` type. In some design systems (for example Tailwind) these colors are referred to as "intents". These theme colors are:

- `brand` - default brand color
- `success` - color used to convey success state (often green)
- `warning` - color used to convey warning state (often orange or yellow)
- `error` - color used to convey danger or error state (often red)
- `info` - color used to convey some kind of information in situation where we can't or don't want to use `brand` color theme (often blue)
- `neutral` - theme color that convey no specific intention or state, should be always gray/grayish

Specific colors (their hex/rgba values) for theme colors are defined by a specific set of design tokens. For Phoenix components and its default Axiory design tokens theme colors are as following:

<Canvas of={Colors.Colors} />

As you can see, there are two sets - primary and secondary. They are used for example for [Button](/docs/components-button--docs) or [Tag](/docs/components-tag--docs) components. Primary is the default appearance and secondary is the background color if prop `secondary` is set. Full set of color tokens can be found on page [Design tokens](/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs).

## Text Color

In addition to theme colors, for some text components ([Text](?path=/docs/components-text--docs), [Paragraph](/docs/components-paragraph--docs) and [Heading](/docs/components-heading--docs)) you can set different text colors (shades of gray) as a `color` prop:

- `primary`
- `secondary`
- `tertiary`
- `quaternary`

<Canvas of={Headings.Headings} />
