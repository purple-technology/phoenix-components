# Spacing

Basic spacing system in Phoenix components is represented by the type called `Spacing`. This type is used throughout multiple different components and their margin and padding props and includes the following options:

- `3xs`
- `2xs`
- `xs`
- `sm`
- `md`
- `lg`
- `xl`
- `2xl`
- `3xl`

Values are defined by a specific set of design tokens, i.e. for different projects, these values might differ. For Phoenix components, we use Axiory design tokens by default. These values can be found in [Design tokens](?path=/docs/foundation-design-tokens--docs). Please see the tokens starting with `ref`:

<DesignTokenDocBlock
	showSearch={false}
	categoryName="Spacing"
	maxHeight={460}
/>

## Margin & padding props

Margin and padding props in Phoenix components are unified and are used by many components where applicable. They use Spacing values as defined above and include these props:

- `ml` - margin-inline-start (= margin-left in standard left-to-right page direction)
- `mr` - margin-inline-end (= margin-right in standard left-to-right page direction)
- `mt` - margin-top
- `mb` - margin-bottom
- `mx` - `ml` and `mr` in a single prop
- `my` - `mt` and `mb` in a single prop
- `m` - margin (shortcut for all margins together)

- `pl` - padding-inline-start (= padding-left in standard left-to-right page direction)
- `pr` - padding-inline-end (= padding-right in standard left-to-right page direction)
- `pt` - padding-top
- `pb` - padding-bottom
- `px` - `pl` and `pr` in a single prop
- `py` - `pt` and `pb` in a single prop
- `p` - padding (shortcut for all paddings together)

In addition to Spacing values they also accept:

- `string` as any CSS value with valid units ("20px", "1.5rem", "100%" etc.)
- `number` which is interpreted as px
